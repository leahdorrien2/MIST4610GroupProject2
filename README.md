# Dataset Description
  For this project, our group chose to use a dataset entitled Selected Online Casino Gambling which can be found at this link https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/selected-online-casino-gaming-data. We obtained our data from a US Data Gov website that was provided, https://catalog.data.gov/dataset. This dataset contains selected online casino gambling data for four licensces in the state of Connecticut. The range of time that this dataset covers is October 21st, 2021 through March 31st, 2025. It lists data from four gambling licensees in the state, including their operating license, financials including wages, monthly payments, patron winnings and losses, and gambling revenue for every fiscal year. 
  
  Three of the four licensees included in this data set are related to the Native American Mohegan tribe in Connecticut, who are a federally recognized tribe that has been operating the Mohegan Sun casino since 1996. It is common for Native American tribes to be heavily involved in the gambling industry as they are often given more leeway from regulators.
  
1. Mohegan Tribe On-Reservation: Refers to Mohegan tribe’s general gambling operations on their federal reservation.

2. MPTN On-Reservation: Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation. The Mohegan tribe were a part of the Pequot tribe until the early-mid 17th century. Refers to the Pequot tribe’s general gambling operations on their federal reservation.

3. MPI Master Wagering License, CT, LLC: A “master” license that covers many other licenses (i.e. key employee license, live employee license). Allows the tribe to operate online casino gaming, sports wagering, and fantasy contests.

4. Mohegan Digital, LLC: A subsidiary of Mohegan Gaming & Entertainment. Handles online gaming gambling platforms, for instance e-bingo or sports betting. 

Each row is data from one license for a particular month.

- Month Ending: The month ending is used for the purposes of calculating monthly payments for that month’s period. Organizations have to make a monthly payout to the state of the 15th of the following month that revenue was gained. For example, the organization can have data from the Month of January– the month ending would be January 31st at 12:00am to notify the organization that the revenue obtained by the business must be contributed towards the monthly payments on the 15th the following month to the state (February 15th).
